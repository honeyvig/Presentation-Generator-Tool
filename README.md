# Presentation-Generator-Tool
I want to create an equivalent version of Beautiful.ai where if I upload a TXT file it can create slides from the text file or if I upload a powerpoint presentation it will make the slides better using AI.

I'm looking to get an MVP version up (not picky about workflow) as long as it can spit out a presentation.

I am not looking to jump on zoom calls with anyone, just see if you can get an mvp version of this up.

Reason why I'm doing this is because I have clients who need their presentations created and so far the only solution I've really found is beautiful.ai but they won't let me have more slides and I have no control over the direction of the software itself.

I would partner up with you (as I know how to market) to get subscribers for this tool if you propose that as well. Or just pay you to make it.

I do want a dashboard created on the backend so I can manage users and the ability for a user to log into the software on the frontend.

===================
To create an MVP version of a presentation generator tool that can create slides from a TXT file or enhance an existing PowerPoint presentation using AI, we need to break down the task into several components. Here's a rough outline of the functionality and the technical steps required:
Core Features:

    File Upload (TXT and PowerPoint):
        The user can upload a .txt file or an existing PowerPoint presentation (.pptx).

    Slide Generation from TXT File:
        Convert the contents of the .txt file into a structured slide format (e.g., splitting content by paragraphs or sections).

    Enhancement of PowerPoint Presentations:
        When a .pptx file is uploaded, use AI to improve the slides' design (for instance, reformatting content or improving text clarity).

    Dashboard for User Management:
        Implement a backend dashboard for managing users.
        Allow users to log in and access their slides.

    Frontend UI for Upload and Presentation Viewing:
        A simple UI for users to upload files and view the generated presentations.

Tools and Technologies:

    Backend:
        Flask/Django (Python) for the backend to handle file uploads, user management, and slide generation.
        SQLite/PostgreSQL for user management and database.

    Frontend:
        HTML/CSS for basic UI; JavaScript or frameworks like React for a more dynamic UI.
        Authentication: Use Flask-Login or Django's built-in authentication system for user login.

    AI for PowerPoint Enhancement:
        Use AI models such as OpenAI's GPT for generating structured text (converting text files into slide content).
        Use libraries like python-pptx to create and modify PowerPoint slides programmatically.

    Slide Generation:
        For TXT file to slides: Extract key sections or paragraphs and convert them into a series of slides.
        For Enhancing PPT: Reformat text, adjust slide layouts, and possibly integrate designs.

Step-by-Step Implementation:

    Backend Setup (Flask Example):

    Install dependencies:

pip install flask python-pptx openai

app.py (Flask Backend Example):

from flask import Flask, request, render_template, redirect, url_for, flash
from flask_login import LoginManager, UserMixin, login_user, login_required, logout_user, current_user
import os
from pptx import Presentation
import openai
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'
login_manager = LoginManager(app)

# Set up OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

# Set up user model
class User(UserMixin):
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id

# Mock database of users (for MVP, use a simple dict)
users = {'admin': {'password': 'admin'}}

# User loader for login system
@login_manager.user_loader
def load_user(user_id):
    return User(user_id)

# Route for the home page
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

# Route to handle file upload
@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        flash('No file part')
        return redirect(request.url)
    file = request.files['file']
    if file.filename == '':
        flash('No selected file')
        return redirect(request.url)
    if file:
        filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
        filepath = os.path.join('uploads', filename)
        file.save(filepath)
        if filename.endswith('.txt'):
            return process_txt_file(filepath)
        elif filename.endswith('.pptx'):
            return process_pptx_file(filepath)

def process_txt_file(filepath):
    # Read the text file and generate slides
    with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    # Generate slides from the text file (basic split)
    slides = content.split('\n\n')  # Split paragraphs as slides
    ppt = Presentation()
    for slide_text in slides:
        slide = ppt.slides.add_slide(ppt.slide_layouts[1])
        textbox = slide.shapes.placeholders[0]
        textbox.text = slide_text
    ppt.save('generated_presentation.pptx')
    return send_from_directory(directory='.', path='generated_presentation.pptx', as_attachment=True)

def process_pptx_file(filepath):
    # Open and enhance the ppt file
    ppt = Presentation(filepath)
    for slide in ppt.slides:
        for shape in slide.shapes:
            if shape.has_text_frame:
                shape.text_frame.text = improve_text(shape.text_frame.text)
    ppt.save('enhanced_presentation.pptx')
    return send_from_directory(directory='.', path='enhanced_presentation.pptx', as_attachment=True)

def improve_text(text):
    # Use AI (e.g., GPT-3) to improve the text (optional)
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"Improve the clarity and design of the following text: {text}",
        max_tokens=200
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Start the app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Frontend (HTML + Simple Form): Create a simple HTML form for file uploads:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Upload Presentation</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Upload Your Presentation</h1>
    <form action="/upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="file" name="file" accept=".txt, .pptx" required><br><br>
        <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>

User Management & Login (Optional for MVP): Implement basic user management (using Flask-Login for authentication) to manage and track users:

    @app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def login():
        if request.method == 'POST':
            username = request.form['username']
            password = request.form['password']
            if username in users and users[username]['password'] == password:
                user = User(username)
                login_user(user)
                return redirect(url_for('home'))
            else:
                flash('Invalid credentials')
        return render_template('login.html')

    Deployment: For MVP, deploy the application using a platform like Heroku or DigitalOcean. Use PostgreSQL or SQLite for user management.

MVP Features:

    File Upload: Upload .txt or .pptx files.
    Text-to-Slides: Convert .txt files into slides (based on paragraphs).
    PowerPoint Enhancement: Improve existing PowerPoint files using AI-based text enhancement.
    User Login: Manage user sessions and files through a basic login system.
    Download Output: Users can download the newly created/enhanced presentation.

This setup will provide the basic functionality to generate and enhance presentations, and you can expand it later with more advanced AI features and designs.
